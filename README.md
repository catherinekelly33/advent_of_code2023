Python has been used as a method to solve the challenges set in the

To date I have completed the
following tasks:

* Day 4 - A and B
* Day 5 - A
* Day 6 - A and B

### Note
To date I have only completed the Codecedemy Learn Python 3 course and therefore
still relatviely new to coding. I am aware the my current code may not be the 
most concise and therefore plan to update / improve the code as I become more 
proficient.
